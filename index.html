                        The incubator shaker is a temperature controlled
                        biochemical instrument combining incubation and shaking
                        functions. It is used in cell culture, fermentation, hybridization,
                        biochemistry and research of enzyme and cell tissues which require
                        a high quality of temperature control and shaking speed.

             <ul>
            <li>Shaking incubators have a specialized design and you can use this equipment
                to incubate and agitate or shake samples simultaneously. They're suitable for different
                applications in laboratories. This equipment is for cell aeration and culture, experiments on
                solubility, and more.
                </li> <br>
            <li>With this equipment, you don't have to place a separate shaker within your incubator. If you
                regularly need to combine incubating and shaking, then a shaking incubator is the right
                product for you. With this, youâ€™ll have a versatile piece of equipment that you can use to
                shake and incubate all your samples.
                    </li> <br> 
                    
                    <li>  Shaking incubators can also help simplify processes in your laboratory. They can also help
                        to improve your control over the operations you perform. Think about it, if you have a
                        separate shaker, it's more complicated. </li> <br>

                        <li> Each time you need to adjust the shaking settings,
                            you have to open your incubator. Because of this, you'll temporarily lose the temperature
                            you've set.  </li> <br>

                            <li> This is why shaking incubators are much more convenient. You merely put your
                                samples inside, adjust the settings, and start the machine.

                        and good air circulation.</li> <br>
                    <li>It should not be used in areas with water,
                        hard light, or corrosive gas and should be kept away from central
                        heating systems.</li> <br>
